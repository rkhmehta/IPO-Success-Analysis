# IPO-Success-Analysis

## Description:
This repository contains the code and data used in the Project, which focuses on determining the success factors of initial public offerings (IPOs). The project analyzes data from multiple sources, including the WRDS IPO database, CRSP monthly stock data, and Compustat executive compensation data, covering the period from 2010 to 2015. Due to the size of the files, I can't upload them on Guthub, please find the link to access the files here(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YsvNj9Cr-PffK85PItvoZ7tjye5-27dv?usp=drive_link).
